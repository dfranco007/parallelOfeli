//! \class ofeli::Filters
//! This class implements filters and noise functions for RGB images. \n
//! There are two linear filters : a mean filter and a gaussian filter. \n
//! Moreover, there are seven operators of mathematical morphology (erosion, dilation, morphological gradient, opening, closing and the both top-hat transforms) with a square for a structuring element. \n
//! Furthermore, there are two edge preserving filters : a median filter and a Perona-Malik anisotropic diffusion. \n
//! The order filters (i.e. the median filter and the morphological filters) are implemented in a naïve version and in an optimized version (using Simon Perreault's algorithm). \n
//! In addition, there are three functions to add noise, implemented with the random variables of Boost library : gaussian white noise, impulsional noise or salt and pepper and speckle.
