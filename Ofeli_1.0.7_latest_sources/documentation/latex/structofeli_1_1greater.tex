\subsection{Detailed Description}
\subsubsection*{template$<$typename T = int$>$struct ofeli\-::greater$<$ T $>$}

This class defines function objects for the \char`\"{}greater than\char`\"{} inequality comparison operation. Generically, function objects are instances of a class with member function {\ttfamily operator()} defined. This member function allows the object to be used with the same syntax as a regular function call, and therefore it can be used in templates instead of a pointer to a function. {\ttfamily greater} has its {\ttfamily operator()} member defined such that it returns {\ttfamily true} if its first argument compares greater than the second one using {\ttfamily operator$>$}, and {\ttfamily false} otherwise. This class can be used with the template function $<$\-T$>$\-::sort(\-Binary\-Predicate compare).
